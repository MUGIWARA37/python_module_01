# Module 01 — Object-Oriented Programming

## Objective

This module introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

The goal is to learn how to model real-world concepts using classes and objects, and how to organize code into reusable and maintainable structures.

---

## What You Learn

- Creating classes and objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Attributes and methods
- Encapsulation and data protection
- Class design and responsibility
- Basic inheritance concepts

---

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Design and implement Python classes
- Structure programs using OOP principles
- Separate data and behavior logically
- Write scalable and maintainable object-oriented code

This module prepares you for more advanced software architecture concepts.
